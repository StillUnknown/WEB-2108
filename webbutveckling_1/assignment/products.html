        <h2>GEFORCE RTX™ 3090 GRAPHICS CARD</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                "GeForce RTX ™ 3090 is a large and strong GPU with performance in the TITAN class. Featuring 2nd
                generation NVIDIA RTX architecture Ampere, which enhances beam tracking and AI performance with enhanced
                beam
                tracking cores, Tensor cores and new streaming multiprocessors. It also has a full 24 GB of G6X memory
                which
                gives you the ultimate gaming experience" -NVIDIA</p>
            <p>
                "Even with the newest AAA games, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 delivers amazing 4K performance and can
                even
                handle 8K gaming at 60fps, though it's not quite perfect at that level. So, while its predecessors may
                have set a high bar to meet, it's proven to be up to the challenge" -Techradar.com
            </p>
            <p>
                "The RTX 3090 is by far the most potent GPU in today’s market. It offers up unrivaled
                gaming performance in modern titles, bringing 4K – and 8K gaming according to Nvidia – at 60 frames per
                second to desktop gaming PCs" -WEPC.com

        <p>"The Samsung 49-Inch Odyssey G9 has the most extreme curve we've seen yet, 1000R, and is one of the best
            gaming monitors we've tested. At a comfortable viewing distance of 2-3 feet, it completely fills your
            peripheral vision. But that's not all, it's a really good-looking monitor too" -Tomshardware.com</p>
        <p>"
            Is the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 Worth Buying? The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is an excellent gaming monitor. It
            delivers as much screen real estate as two 27-inch monitors without a bezel in the center and with an
